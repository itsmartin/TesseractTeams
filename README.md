TesseractTeams
=========

Just a simple, lightweight teams plugin I wrote for an experimental server.

Installation
============

* Download the plugin jar file and install it in your server's /plugins folder.

Features
========

* Create teams
* Players can join random teams
* Private team chat

Usage
=====

A list of commands is available by typing **/help tesseractteams**.

Configuration of teams should be done using the config.yml file. A sample config.yml will be created when you first run the plugin.

The following commands are available to players:

* **/reloadteams** - reload teams from the configuration file (ops only)
* **/join** - puts you on a random team
* **/leave** - leaves the team
* **/teams** - list all teams
* **/t (message)** - send a message only to your teammates


Download
========

No download is currently available.

Release notes
=============

The current plugin is still in alpha form. It appears fairly stable, but there may be some remaining bugs. Please report any bugs
via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/itsmartin/TesseractTeams/issues).
